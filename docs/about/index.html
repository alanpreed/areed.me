      <h2>About this site</h2>
<p>I'm Alan, someone who likes to spend his spare time tinkering on projects across a range of disciplines. Over the years I've dabbled in a whole bunch of areas, including: software, electronics, embedded systems, bicycles, car maintenance, woodwork, 3D printing and more.</p>
<p>This site was created by me, as a place for me to document some of my experiences in these projects. Primarily I expect it to serve as a reference for my future self, however hopefully others may find some of the information here useful too. It is hosted via GitHub pages from <a href="https://github.com/alanpreed/areed.me">this repository</a>.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>For more information about any of the content hosted here, feel free to contact me via email at <a href="mailto:alan@areed.me">alan@areed.me</a>. You can also find me on <a href="https://github.com/alanpreed/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanpreed/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
