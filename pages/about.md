## About this site

I'm Alan, someone who likes to spend his spare time tinkering on projects across a range of disciplines. Over the years I've dabbled in a whole bunch of areas, including: software, electronics, embedded systems, bicycles, car maintenance, woodwork, 3D printing and more.

This site was created by me, as a place for me to document some of my experiences in these projects. Primarily I expect it to serve as a reference for my future self, however hopefully others may find some of the information here useful too. It is hosted via GitHub pages from [this repository](https://github.com/alanpreed/areed.me).

## Contact
