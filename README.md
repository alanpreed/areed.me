## Introduction

This is the repository for the material found on my personal website, hosted via GitHub Pages at [areed.me](https://areed.me).

## Local development
Setup for local development by running:

    npm install

A local copy of the site can then be loaded by running the following:

    npx @11ty/eleventy --serve

The local site can be accessed via the URL output in the console while the above is running, and should automatically update as files are changed.
